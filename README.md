CornellMasterProject_ImageProcessingControlledAutonomousQuadcopter
==================================================================

One year project in Cornell ECE master of engineering program. Based on some third-party skeleton, 
implemented several algorithms which can make the quadcopter perform actions like tracking, avoiding obstacle,
multi-actions and so on.

Details:

1 Designed, developed, and tested computer vision application. Enabled quadcopter to complete tracking, 
face recognition and 3D reconstruction.
2 Implemented wireless environment to connect multiple quadcopters and user controlling device, so that 
multiple quadcopters can perform interacting task.
